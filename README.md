# Getting your environment set up.

## Github
Having a [Github](https://github.com/) account is a must, signing up is free. Make sure you sign up with an active email account and make a username that is professional. (you can't change it later) [firstname_lastname] is always easy to remember and also ensures people find your account quickly. 

## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. Basically it's awesome and the learning curve is very mild. 


## Trello
A [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US/tour) board is a list of lists, filled with cards, used by you and your team. It's a lot more than that, though. Trello has everything you need to organize projects of any size. Open a card and you can add comments, upload file attachments, create checklists, add labels and due dates, and more.
