# Getting your environment set up.

## Github
Having a [Github](https://github.com/) account is a must, signing up is free. Make sure you sign up with an active email account and make a username that is professional. (you can't change it later) [firstname_lastname] is always easy to remember and also ensures people find your account quickly. 

## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. Basically it's awesome and the learning curve is very mild.
